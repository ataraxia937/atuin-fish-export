# atuin-fish-export

This tool exports the history from the Atuin database and imports it to the fish shell history database.
This is useful because it allows fish's autosuggestions to be correct and helpful on a new install,
when Atuin has your history, but fish doesn't.

## Installation

```fish
go install github.com/ataraxia937/atuin-fish-export
```

## Usage

```fish
atuin-fish-export
```
